These codes are implements of using the gelsight-mini sensor to perceive and manipulate objects, the author could 未来还会不断地完善。  

Before using these codes, the user need install the gelsight SDK and the [corresponding environment](https://github.com/gelsightinc/gsrobotics).

The codes that perceiving the moving trend of the grasped object：**main.py, main-TCP.py, image_flow.py**

The codes that detecting the press to the deformable face：**image_filter.py, gelsight_mapping.py, gelsight_mapping2.py**

The codes that estimating the relative position between the peg and the hole (the python codes need to be associated with the robot controlling codes)：**face_detection.py, edge_detection.py**
